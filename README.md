Computer-aided synthesis of MOFs 

Development of the MONOSYN prediction tool

Description: This project aims to develop a prediction tool that can simulate virtual UTSA-16 MOF syntheses and predict the material characteristic properties based on a user-specified set of synthesis conditions.

A list of all python codes used in this project along with their functions are summarized in the "List of Python Codes & their Functions" excel file

Python codes used in this project are available in two branches titled “Python-Codes-(part-1/2) & Python-Codes-(part-2/2)”
